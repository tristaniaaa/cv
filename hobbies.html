          Modifying video games, or modding, lets you tweak various aspects of
          the game. Modding is a great way to practice Java in a fun way outside
          of the work environment. Modding can range from simple tweaks to
          complete overhauls of the game. This can also make the video game more
          interesting beyond its original lifespan. This boosts skills like
          research, adapting code, self-expression and cooperation.
